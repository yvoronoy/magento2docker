# Magento2 Docker Environment
Magento2 Docker Environment based on LAMP stack. Tested on docker for mac.
This project uses SSHFS to mount container directory on a host machine. Due to docker issue [File access in mounted volumes extremely slow](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77).

I used to Docker Sync project before to synchronize files by UNISON. But it brokes very often,because Magento2 has huge amount of files. So I decided to move on SSHFS. It works pretty well and performance is enough on a host machine. Container works without any performance issue since it does not share volumes.

## Installation
You can download archive of this project on [Release Page](https://github.com/yvoronoy/magento2docker/releases). 

Or just clone this repository ```git clone git@github.com:yvoronoy/magento2docker.git```

## Usage
### Quick Start
Commands should be executed from _env_ directory.
Run make command to run developer environment.

```
make dev
```
That command will run docker-compose and mount sshfs into host src directory.

### How to install a magento inside container
   - Login to container `make web`
   - Create a directory e.g: magento2
   - Inside the magento2 directory run `m2install.sh -s composer -v 2.2.6`
   - Open browser and go to http://magento2.127.0.0.1.xip.io/

### How to deploy dumps (backups) inside container
 - Put dumps to src folder on your host machine
   - Login to container `make web` 
   - Run `m2install.sh`

## How to Enable xDebug

The container already includes PHP xDebug extension. The xDebug extension is disabled by default because
it is dramatically decrease performance.

### Pre-requirements
xDebug configuration is using remote host ip = 10.254.254.254.

### Usage
 - Login to your container `make web`
 - Run command `xdebug-php.sh 1`
 - Run IDE (PHPStorm) and press button _Start Listening for PHPDebug Connection_

## Todo List
 - [x] Add xDebug and provide guide how to setup xDebug on your host machine.
 - [x] Add useful tools like: n98-magerun2, m2install.sh, magento-bash-completion.
 - [ ] Setup Cron.
 - [x] Add self-signed SSL certificate.
 - [ ] Add Magento Testing Framework for functional tests.
 - [ ] Add Solr Search Engine.
 - [ ] Add Blackfire tool.
